Thin python wrapper around the public PUBG api.

This api wrapper is completely synchronous, and as such, is not a suitable option for
large scale application! I recommend using it for prototyping and moving to a more scaleable
solution later.

To use the wrapper, put your API key in a "apikey.env" file.
